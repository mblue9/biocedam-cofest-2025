## Overview

Finding the right bioinformatics software can be tricky. [Bioconductor alone has over 3,000 R packages](https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/BiocViews.html#___Software), each with its own focus, but describing them in a way thatâ€™s consistent and searchable is a challenge.

One approach weâ€™re exploring is [**biocEDAM**](https://github.com/vjcitn/biocEDAM), an experimental R package (in active development on GitHub) that already works with OpenAIâ€™s GPTâ€‘4o to extract and suggest [EDAM ontology](https://edamontology.org/) terms for Bioconductor packages. These tags improve discoverability and interoperability across the ecosystem.

However, using OpenAI requires an API key and billing setup, which can be a barrier. At CoFest we want to build on this foundation by adding [**Gemini's free tier**](https://dev.to/garciadiazjaime/gemini-api-the-free-tier-that-makes-developers-happy-28nk) (via [Ellmer](https://ellmer.tidyverse.org/)) as an additional backend, offering a noâ€‘cost, keyâ€‘free option that makes the tool easier for anyone to try. Weâ€™ll also refine prompts and test it on more packages.

Weâ€™re also keen to explore future approaches, such as how [**Model Context Protocols (MCPs)**](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/introduction) might help LLMs access package metadata, and to hear from domain specialists on which terms best describe tools in their fields.  

While our current tooling uses EDAM, we know EDAM alone doesnâ€™t cover everything. Input from people experienced in combining ontologies (like Wikidata or domain vocabularies) would be very welcome.

## Goals

**Core Goals (2â€‘day focus)**

- Explore adding Gemini backend support to `biocEDAM`
- Test `biocEDAM` on additional Bioconductor packages
- Collect feedback on EDAM term coverage and prompt quality
- Discuss how MCPs could support ontologyâ€‘aware metadata

**Stretch Goals (if time allows)**

- Abstract the LLM interface to support multiple providers
- Outline a followâ€‘up community blog post to share CoFest outcomes
- Sketch how MCP integration might look in future tooling

## Participants

**All welcome! You might be:**

- An R developer interested in tooling
- An ontology or metadata expert
- An LLM/NLP practitioner curious about applied use cases
- A Bioconductor package developer or user
- A domain expert with ideas on how your fieldâ€™s software should be described

## Getting Started (Beginner-Friendly)

We welcome contributors of all experience levels - including beginners!
[Beginner's guide / onboarding document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1i-YmUrXxyftS4lxopGX5i5C7UEfs_HXYuHS2_UFIDJ8/edit?usp=sharing)

If you're new to ontologies, R, or LLMs, here are a few simple ways to contribute:

- Try running biocEDAM on a Bioconductor package (we can help you pick one!)
- Review the EDAM terms it suggests - do they make sense?
- Suggest improvements to the prompts or tag mappings
- Join discussions on how software in your field should be described
- Weâ€™ll be on site (Maria and Sebastian) and happy to guide you through setup or answer questions, feel free to drop by.

## Input

- [Google doc here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1wc6Gt0zsrNWJkL13Fp3GvMOtoj2rDxCBgFnqbLnhuxU/edit?usp=sharing). Feel free to add your name if you're interested in this project, and to start connecting with others. You're also welcome to add any questions or comments.
